-->
### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page][releases]
2. Extract the archive
3. Copy the `elro_connects_realtime` directory to your `custom_components` directory
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Go to Configuration ‚Üí Integrations
6. Click "+" and search for "ELRO Connects Real-time"
7. Follow the configuration steps

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the integration, you need:

1. **ELRO Connects Hub**: A functioning ELRO Connects hub connected to your network
2. **Hub IP Address**: The local IP address of your hub (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. **Device ID**: The unique identifier of your hub (usually starts with `ST_`)

### Finding Your Hub Information

#### Method 1: Router/Network Scanner
- Check your router's device list for "ELRO" or similar device
- Use a network scanner app to find devices on port 1025

#### Method 2: ELRO Connects Mobile App
- Open the ELRO Connects mobile app
- Go to hub settings to find the Device ID
- The IP address can be found in your router's DHCP client list

#### Method 3: Network Traffic Analysis
- Use Wireshark or similar tool to capture UDP traffic on port 1025
- Look for messages containing device identifiers starting with `ST_`

### Setup Steps

1. Go to **Configuration** ‚Üí **Integrations**
2. Click the **"+"** button
3. Search for **"ELRO Connects Real-time"**
4. Enter your hub information:
   - **IP Address**: Your hub's local IP address
   - **Device ID**: Your hub's device identifier (e.g., `ST_ab4f224febfd`)
   - **Control Key**: Leave as default (`0`) unless specified otherwise
   - **App ID**: Leave as default (`0`) unless specified otherwise
5. Click **Submit**

The integration will automatically discover and configure your devices.

## Usage

### Entities

After setup, you'll see entities for each of your ELRO Connects devices:

#### Binary Sensors
- **Door/Window Sensors**: Show as `binary_sensor.device_name_door_window`
  - State: `on` (open) / `off` (closed)
- **Alarm Devices**: Show as `binary_sensor.device_name_alarm`
  - State: `on` (alarm triggered) / `off` (normal)

#### Sensors
- **Battery Levels**: Show as `sensor.device_name_battery`
  - Value: Battery percentage (0-100%)

### Services

The integration provides several services for device management:

#### `elro_connects_realtime.test_alarm`
Test the alarm on a specific device.

```yaml
service: elro_connects_realtime.test_alarm
target:
  entity_id: binary_sensor.smoke_detector_alarm
```

#### `elro_connects_realtime.sync_devices`
Force synchronization of all devices.

```yaml
service: elro_connects_realtime.sync_devices
```

#### `elro_connects_realtime.get_device_names`
Refresh device names from the hub.

```yaml
service: elro_connects_realtime.get_device_names
```

### Automation Examples

#### Fire Alarm Notification
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Fire Alarm Triggered"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.fire_alarm_alarm
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "üî• FIRE ALARM!"
          message: "Fire alarm has been triggered!"
          data:
            priority: high
            ttl: 0
```

#### Door/Window Monitor
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Door Left Open"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door_door_window
        to: "on"
        for: "00:05:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.persistent_notification
        data:
          title: "Door Alert"
          message: "Front door has been open for 5 minutes"
```

#### Low Battery Alert
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Low Battery Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: 
          - sensor.smoke_detector_battery
          - sensor.door_sensor_battery
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_your_phone
        data:
          title: "Low Battery"
          message: "{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.friendly_name }} battery is at {{ trigger.to_state.state }}%"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Connection Failed
- Verify the hub IP address is correct
- Ensure the hub is powered on and connected to your network
- Check that port 1025 is not blocked by your firewall
- Try pinging the hub IP address from your Home Assistant host

#### No Devices Discovered
- Wait a few minutes after setup for initial device discovery
- Use the `elro_connects.sync_devices` service to force discovery
- Check that your devices are properly paired with the hub
- Ensure devices have sufficient battery level

#### Devices Show as Unavailable
- Check device battery levels
- Verify devices are within range of the hub
- Use the `elro_connects.get_device_names` service to refresh
- Restart the integration if issues persist

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.elro_connects_realtime: debug
```

### Network Requirements

- **Protocol**: UDP
- **Port**: 1025
- **Network**: Hub and Home Assistant must be on the same local network
- **Firewall**: Ensure UDP port 1025 is not blocked
